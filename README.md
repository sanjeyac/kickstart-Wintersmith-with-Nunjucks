# Kickstart project for Wintersmith and Nunjucks

Wintersmith comes with jade while I prefer Nunjucks templating system (  without abstractions over html ). So I created this project for each time that I need a new project with Wintersmith and Nunjucks, and a template with Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

Links:
* [Wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith)
* [Nunjucks](http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)

## Install
This projects needs node, npm and wintersmith. If you have already installed them, then execute this commands:
```
git https://github.com/sanjeyac/kickstart-Wintersmith-with-Nunjucks.git
npm install
wintersmith preview
```
That's all! 
Now you have a Wintersmith project with Nunjucks, Bootstrap and Font Awesome!
